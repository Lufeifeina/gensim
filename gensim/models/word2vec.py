"""
Deep learning via word2vec's "skip-gram and CBOW models", using either
hierarchical softmax or negative sampling [1]_ [2]_.

The training algorithms were originally ported from the C package https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
and extended with additional functionality.

For a blog tutorial on gensim word2vec, with an interactive web app trained on GoogleNews, visit http://radimrehurek.com/2014/02/word2vec-tutorial/

**Make sure you have a C compiler before installing gensim, to use optimized (compiled) word2vec training**
(70x speedup compared to plain NumPy implementation [3]_).

Initialize a model with e.g.::

>>> model = Word2Vec(sentences, size=100, window=5, min_count=5, workers=4)

Persist a model to disk with::

>>> model.save(fname)
>>> model = Word2Vec.load(fname)  # you can continue training with the loaded model!

The model can also be instantiated from an existing file on disk in the word2vec C format::

  >>> model = Word2Vec.load_word2vec_format('/tmp/vectors.txt', binary=False)  # C text format
  >>> model = Word2Vec.load_word2vec_format('/tmp/vectors.bin', binary=True)  # C binary format

You can perform various syntactic/semantic NLP word tasks with the model. Some of them
are already built-in::

  >>> model.most_similar(positive=['woman', 'king'], negative=['man'])
  [('queen', 0.50882536), ...]

  >>> model.doesnt_match("breakfast cereal dinner lunch".split())
  'cereal'

  >>> model.similarity('woman', 'man')
  0.73723527

  >>> model['computer']  # raw numpy vector of a word
  array([-0.00449447, -0.00310097,  0.02421786, ...], dtype=float32)

and so on.

If you're finished training a model (=no more updates, only querying), you can do

  >>> model.init_sims(replace=True)

to trim unneeded model memory = use (much) less RAM.

Note that there is a :mod:`gensim.models.phrases` module which lets you automatically
detect phrases longer than one word. Using phrases, you can learn a word2vec model
where "words" are actually multiword expressions, such as `new_york_times` or `financial_crisis`:

>>> bigram_transformer = gensim.models.Phrases(sentences)
>>> model = Word2Vec(bigram_transformed[sentences], size=100, ...)

        Initialize the model from an iterable of `sentences`. Each sentence is a
        list of words (unicode strings) that will be used for training.

        The `sentences` iterable can be simply a list, but for larger corpora,
        consider an iterable that streams the sentences directly from disk/network.
        See :class:`BrownCorpus`, :class:`Text8Corpus` or :class:`LineSentence` in
        this module for such examples.

        If you don't supply `sentences`, the model is left uninitialized -- use if
        you plan to initialize it in some other way.

        `sg` defines the training algorithm. By default (`sg=1`), skip-gram is used. Otherwise, `cbow` is employed.

        `size` is the dimensionality of the feature vectors.

        `window` is the maximum distance between the current and predicted word within a sentence.

        `alpha` is the initial learning rate (will linearly drop to zero as training progresses).

        `seed` = for the random number generator. Initial vectors for each
        word are seeded with a hash of the concatenation of word + str(seed).

        `min_count` = ignore all words with total frequency lower than this.

        `sample` = threshold for configuring which higher-frequency words are randomly downsampled;
            default is 0 (off), useful value is 1e-5.

        `workers` = use this many worker threads to train the model (=faster training with multicore machines).

        `hs` = if 1 (default), hierarchical sampling will be used for model training (else set to 0).

        `negative` = if > 0, negative sampling will be used, the int for negative
        specifies how many "noise words" should be drawn (usually between 5-20).

        `cbow_mean` = if 0 (default), use the sum of the context word vectors. If 1, use the mean.
        Only applies when cbow is used.

        `hashfxn` = hash function to use to randomly initialize weights, for increased
        training reproducibility. Default is Python's rudimentary built in hash function.

        `iter` = number of iterations (epochs) over the corpus.
